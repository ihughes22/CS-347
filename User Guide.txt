User Guide:

To use the testing software, you have to edit the 'data' array in the main section of the code. 
You can use any of these commands, but you have to use their specific inputs to use them correctly. 

Friendly hint: CRASH terminates the code (because of the car accident accident) so keep in mind to use it at the end after testing other cases.
